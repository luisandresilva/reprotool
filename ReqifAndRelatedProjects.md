# ReqIF / RIF #

The Requirements Interchange Format (ReqIF, formerly RIF) is OMG's format for requirement exchange. It serves as "container" for requirements whose type and structure can be expressed in ReqIF.

ReqIF format implementation based on EMF model has been announced recently in RMF project proposal.

Some interesting tools already use EMF based ReqIF implementation - see [ProR](http://pror.org/) and [Yakindu CReMa](http://www.guersoy.net/knowledge/crema) screencasts.
